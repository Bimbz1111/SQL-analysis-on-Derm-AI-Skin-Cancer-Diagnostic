DERM AI Diagnostic contacted us to develop an SQL analysis to provide data driven insights that empowers medical professionals in daignosing and treating skin lesions more accurately enhance early skin cancer detection.

I extracted, transformed and load the diagnostic data using **Postgresql**
I performed a **Unified data Integration** by joining demographics with lesion characteristics tables to identify key trends 
I conducted some **data segmentation** to understand the number of patients with Malignant and Benign type of the disease.

I integrated tables from environmental factors and demographic factors and wrote queries to identify key insights to see if environmental factors, lifestyle choices and demographic such as Age, smoking, alcohol drinking,access to medical facilities, good hygiene have a significant impact on the disease and early intervention.

**some of the key features of the data sets** 

**Key Features (Metrics Overview):**
- **Unified Data Integration:** Merged patient demographics with lesion characteristics for cohesive analysis.
- **Risk Segmentation:** Analyzed risk factors based on age, gender, smoking, drinking, and pesticide exposure.
- **Lesion Symptoms:** Examined manifestations such as itching, bleeding, elevation, and color change.


**Insights Gained:**
- **Age Is a Critical Factor:** The likelihood of malignancy increases sharply after age 40, with patients 60+ experiencing over 80% malignancy rates.
- **Lifestyle Risks Accelerate Malignancy:** 95% of drinkers and 97% of smokers developed malignant lesions; those who both smoked and drank faced nearly 100% malignancy rates.
- **Lesion Size Matters:** Larger lesions strongly correlate with malignancy, emphasizing the need for immediate screening in patients with wide-diameter lesions.
- **Size Signals Danger:** Larger lesions should prompt urgent diagnostic evaluation.
- **Male Predominance:** Men exhibit slightly higher malignancy rates, likely due to greater environmental exposures.


### **Conclusions & Recommendations:**
- **Targeted Screening:** Focusing on early detection in older adults and individuals with a history of cancer has a long way to go in early detection .
- **Lifestyle Interventions:** Promoting public health campaigns to address lifestyle risks such as smoking and alcohol consumption is highly significant as well.
- **Healthcare Accessibility:** Improving access to health care in underserved areas to facilitate earlier detection and treatment.
- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** Developing models by skin physicians that factors in lesion size and location for improved accuracy can go a long way too.
